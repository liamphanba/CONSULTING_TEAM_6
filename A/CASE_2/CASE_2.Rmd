# Client Case

> A study was carried out at a hospital to compare the effects of four different types of anaesthetic as used in major operations.
>
> 80 patients undergoing a variety of operations were randomly assigned to one of the four anaesthetics and a variety of observations were taken on each patient both before and after the operation.
>
> 1.  The client is interested on just one of the measurements made, namely the time, in minutes, from the reversal of the anaesthetic until the patient opened the eyes.
> 2.  The client would like to know if there is any evidence of differences between the effects of the four anaesthetics?

# Definitions

> **Anaesthesia means "loss of sensation". Medicines that cause anaesthesia are called anaesthetics.**
>
> Anaesthetics are used during tests and surgical operations to numb sensation in certain areas of the body or induce sleep.
>
> This prevents pain and discomfort, and enables a wide range of medical procedures to be carried out.
>
> Local anaesthetics and general anaesthetics are 2 commonly used types of anaesthetics:
>
> -   [local anaesthesia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/) is where a small area of the body is numbed and you remain fully conscious -- often used during minor procedures
>
> -   [general anaesthesia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/) is where you're totally unconscious and unaware of the procedure -- often used for more serious operations

# Analysis

## 1. Data Exploratory Analysis

### Outliers

```{r Outliers}

Outliers <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted[Aanaesthetics_Pivoted$Patient %in% c(41,30,31),]

datatable(Outliers, caption = "Outliers")

```

### Weird Patients

```{r}

Weird_Patient <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted[Aanaesthetics_Pivoted$Time == 0,]

datatable(Weird_Patient, caption = "Weird Patients")

```

> Weird Patient having 0 minute recorded in the process... Need to talk about Data Collecting Phase !

### Boxplots

```{r Boxplots}

Boxplot <- ggplot(Aanaesthetics_Pivoted) +
 aes(x = Anaesthetic, y = Time, fill=Anaesthetic) +
 geom_boxplot() + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#435250", "#2F4F4E", "#0D8387", "#CBE4DE")) + labs(title = "Boxplots", subtitle = "Aanesthetics", caption = "©2023 Alpine Insights", y="Minutes") +  theme_minimal() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + theme(legend.position = "none") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=15,face = "bold")) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size =12))

Boxplot

```

### Histograms

```{r Histograms}


med <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted %>% group_by(Anaesthetic) %>% summarise(median = median(Time))


Histograms <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted %>% ggplot( aes(x=Time, fill=Anaesthetic)) + 
  geom_histogram( color="#e9ecef", alpha=1, position = 'identity', binwidth = 1) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#2B3433", "#2F4F4E", "#0D8387", "#CBE4DE")) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(fill="") +

```

## 2. Core Analysis

### Anova Test

```{r Anova Test}

ANOVA <- aov(Time ~ Anaesthetic, data = Aanaesthetics_Pivoted)

ANOVA_Summary <- summary(ANOVA)

ANOVA_Summary

```

> P-Value Over 5% and 10%, We cannot reject Null Hypothesis, then they are all the same

### Check Assumptions

#### Plots

```{r Anova Checks}

# Plot ANOVA Residuals
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(ANOVA)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

# Extract the residuals
ANOVA_Residuals <- residuals(object = ANOVA )

```

> Residuals not very good. Need to check Normality and Homogeneity (All populations variances are equal).

#### Levene Test For Homogeneity

> "Levene's test is an alternative to Bartlett's test when the data is not normally distributed. So, we consider the null and alternate hypotheses.
>
> -   The Null hypothesis is variances across all samples are equal. 
>
> -   The alternative hypothesis is at least one sample has a different variance.
>
> -    We will test the null hypothesis at 0.05 significance level i.e 95% percentile."

[Levene’s Test in R Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/levenes-test-in-r-programming/)

```{r Levene Test}

leveneTest(Time ~ Anaesthetic, data = Aanaesthetics_Pivoted)

```

> We cannot reject at 0.05, thus variance across all samples are equals (Homogeneity met).


#### Normality Plot 

```{r Normal plots}

GroupA <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted[Aanaesthetics_Pivoted$Anaesthetic == "A",]
A <- ggplot(GroupA, aes(sample = Time))
A + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = "QQ-Plot", subtitle = "Aanesthetic A", caption = "©2023 Alpine Insights", y="Minutes") +  theme_minimal() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + theme(legend.position = "none") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=8,face = "bold")) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size =12)) 

GroupB <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted[Aanaesthetics_Pivoted$Anaesthetic == "B",]
B <- ggplot(GroupB, aes(sample = Time))
B + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = "QQ-Plot", subtitle = "Aanesthetic B", caption = "©2023 Alpine Insights", y="Minutes") +  theme_minimal() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + theme(legend.position = "none") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=8,face = "bold")) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size =12))  
  
GroupC <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted[Aanaesthetics_Pivoted$Anaesthetic == "C",]
C <- ggplot(GroupC, aes(sample = Time))
C + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = "QQ-Plot", subtitle = "Aanesthetic C", caption = "©2023 Alpine Insights", y="Minutes") +  theme_minimal() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + theme(legend.position = "none") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=8,face = "bold")) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size =12)) 

GroupD <- Aanaesthetics_Pivoted[Aanaesthetics_Pivoted$Anaesthetic == "D",]
D <- ggplot(GroupD, aes(sample = Time))
D + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = "QQ-Plot", subtitle = "Aanesthetic D", caption = "©2023 Alpine Insights", y="Minutes") +  theme_minimal() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + theme(legend.position = "none") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=8,face = "bold")) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size =12)) 

```

#### Shapiro-Wilk Test For Normality

> "The Shapiro-Wilk\'s test or Shapiro test is a normality test in frequentist statistics. The null hypothesis of Shapiro\'s test is that the population is distributed normally. It is among the three tests for normality designed for detecting all kinds of departure from normality. If the value of p is equal to or less than 0.05, then the hypothesis of normality will be rejected by the Shapiro test. On failing, the test can state that the data will not fit the distribution normally with 95% confidence."

[Shapiro–Wilk Test in R Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shapiro-wilk-test-in-r-programming/)

```{r Shapiro-Wilk Test}

shapiro.test(x = ANOVA_Residuals)

```

> We can reject at 0.05, thus the normality is not met.

### Distributions of Groups

```{r Distribution}

descdist(Aanaesthetics$A, discrete = FALSE)

descdist(Aanaesthetics$B, discrete = FALSE)

descdist(Aanaesthetics$C, discrete = FALSE)

descdist(Aanaesthetics$D, discrete = FALSE)

```

> We can see that all Anaesthetic groups are beta distributed, thus the Shapiro–Wilk Test being rejected.

> We can deal with the Assumptions for ANOVA not being met with a Non-Parametric Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test giving the same answer to ANOVA. 

### Kurskal-Wallis Test

```{r Kruskal-Wallis Non-parametric}

# Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, which can be used when ANNOVA assumptions are not met
kruskal.test(Time ~ Anaesthetic, data = Aanaesthetics_Pivoted)

```

> We cannot reject Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test, thus there is no differences in groups mean.
